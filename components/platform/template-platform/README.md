## Start with H2's

This is the README for the "Template Platform" as configured in the metadata.hcl file.

We generate the H1 for your component page in HashiCorp Developer, which will be the `component.name` as specified in the `metadata.hcl` file.

We support [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) rendering, so you are free to leverage markdown within this document.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
